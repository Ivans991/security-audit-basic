# Security Recommendations

## 1. Firewall Configuration
Ensure that the Windows Firewall is enabled and properly configured to block unnecessary inbound connections.

## 2. Service Exposure Reduction
Disable or restrict access to services such as SMB and RPC if they are not required, especially on public networks.

## 3. Network Segmentation
Avoid exposing internal services to external networks. Use private networks and trusted connections whenever possible.

## 4. System Updates
Maintain the operating system and installed software updated with the latest security patches.

## 5. Periodic Security Reviews
Perform periodic scans and reviews to identify changes in the system's attack surface.
